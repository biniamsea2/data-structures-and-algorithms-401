## Features:  
- Conduct a depth first preorder traversal on a graph


Create a function that accepts an adjacency list as a graph, and conducts a depth first traversal. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order.  

Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.
