## Features:  
- Given a business trip itinerary, and an Alaska Airlines route map, is the trip possible with direct flights? If so, how much will the total trip cost be?

Write a function based on the specifications above, which takes in a graph, and an array of city names.
 Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return whether the full trip is possible with direct flights, and how much it would cost.  
## Unit Tests:
Write at least three test assertions for each method that you define.  

Ensure your tests are passing before you submit your solution.
