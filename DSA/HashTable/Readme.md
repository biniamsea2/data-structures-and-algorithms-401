## Code Challenge: HashTable
*Author: Biniam Tesfamariam*

---


### Features:  
##### Implement a Hashtable with the following methods:
- Add takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed. The Time and Space complexity of this problem is:  
| Time (worst case)  | Space  
O(n) | O(n)
- Get takes in the key and returns the value from the table.  The Time and Space complexity of this problem is:  
| Time (worst case) | Space  
O(n) | O(n)
- Contains takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already. The Time and Space complexity of this problem is:  
| Time (worst case) | Space  
O(n) | O(n)
- Hash takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection. The Time and Space complexity of this problem is:  
| Time (worst case) | Space  
O(n) | O(n)
