## Queue Stacks.
*Author: Biniam Tesfamariam*

### Problem Domain


Create a brand new PseudoQueue class. Do not use an existing Queue. 
Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue 
interface (the two methods listed below), but will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects. 
Ensure that you create your class with the following methods:

- Enqueue(value) which inserts value into the PsedoQueue, using 
a First In First Out approach.
- Dequeue() which extracts a value fromt the PseudoQueue using First
In First Out approach.

### Inputs and Expected Outputs

Enqueue(value)

| Input |Args |Expected Output | 
| :----------- | :----------- |
| [10,15,20], | 5 | [5,10,15,20] |


Dequeue()

| Input | Args| Expected Output |
| :----------- | :----------- |
| [5,10,15,20] | 20 | [5,10,15,] |
