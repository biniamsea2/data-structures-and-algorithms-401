### Problem Domain:  
##### Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a tree while traversing through it. Change the values of each of the nodes dependent on the current node’s value 
---

### Specifications:  
Write a function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument.  
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine weather or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both, and change the value of each of the nodes:  

If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz” 
 
If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”  

If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”  

Return the tree with its new values.
